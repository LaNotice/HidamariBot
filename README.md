# Custom Reversed Server Discord Bot

## Requirements (Windows only)
- FFmpeg  
  This bot uses FFmpeg to convert stream to Opus in the Ogg format. You can download pre-built FFmpeg binaries [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html). You can either put the downloaded binary in the bot's working directory or add `ffmpeg` to PATH.
